okay .
first i greet you all .
i am from saddle lake , but now today i live in edmonton .
i ’m going to speak about how i came to teach myself cree .
sometimes it ’s hard here , in the city .
people usually always use english .
me too often , i speak english everyday .
despite this i persevere everyday to teach myself cree .
when we were children , our parents didn ’t speak cree to us , when we were growing up .
for me , every day i try to speak cree with my daughters , teaching them all kinds of things everyday , like ‘what ’s your name , ’ ‘where are you from , ’ ‘how old are you . ’
everyday i try teaching them different things .
and now my daughters , sometimes they use cree often , understanding a little .
i ’m happy when i hear them use cree .
it feels nice , when i hear it , young people using this language , the cree language .
i thought it was good then how he taght cree , with syllabics .
he would often constantly tell us spiritual stories .
i was happy then , he knows a lot , for instance how cree words are pronounced .
he knows a lot .
and we stand up together for our language .
and , here , it ’s hard .
english , all , well , everyone here they all speak english .
and also , i remember once , what my father told me : we were given this language to use in prayer .
that ’s why i understand this cree language .
every morning , when i wake up , i try to use this language in prayer , just as my father told me .
and also , we are often helped by other cree speakers to understand the language .
i like it , i ’m grateful to other cree speakers who helped me .
that ’s all i want to say for now .
that ’s all i want to say for now .
i ’m very grateful to all of you for what you asked me .
thank you .
