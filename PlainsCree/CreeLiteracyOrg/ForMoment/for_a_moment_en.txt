She has a baby, 
she’s moved away,
She left her parents,
She’s gone oh so far,
Her baby cries, she cries along,
She’s thinking of her siblings too,

For one moment she was at home,
Where she was loved,
For one moment she was at home,
Happiness,

She hitchhikes, she gets into the vehicle,
That’s the last time she’s seen,
She is found (murdered)
Her baby cries, her mom does too,
She’s thought of all the time,

For one moment she was at home,
Where she was loved,
For one moment she was at home,
Happiness,

Her baby cries, her mom does too,
She’s thought of all the time.
