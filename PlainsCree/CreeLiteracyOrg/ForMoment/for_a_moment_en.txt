she has a baby ,
she ’s moved away ,
she left her parents ,
she ’s gone oh so far ,
her baby cries , she cries along ,
she ’s thinking of her siblings too ,

for one moment she was at home ,
where she was loved ,
for one moment she was at home ,
happiness ,

she hitchhikes , she gets into the vehicle ,
that ’s the last time she ’s seen ,
she is found murdered
her baby cries , her mom does too ,
she ’s thought of all the time ,

for one moment she was at home ,
where she was loved ,
for one moment she was at home ,
happiness ,

her baby cries , her mom does too ,
she ’s thought of all the time .
