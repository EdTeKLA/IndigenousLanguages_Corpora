(0:04) Okay.
First I greet you all.
I am from Saddle Lake, but now today I live in Edmonton (beaver hills house). (0:17)
I’m going to speak about how I came to teach myself Cree.
Sometimes it’s hard here, in the city.
People usually always use English.
Me too often, I speak English everyday.
Despite this I persevere everyday to teach myself Cree.
When we were children, our parents didn’t speak Cree to us, when we were growing up.
For me (1:00), every day I try to speak Cree with my daughters, teaching them all kinds of things everyday, like ‘what’s your name,’ ‘where are you from,’ ‘how old are you.’
(1:19) Everyday I try teaching them different things.
And now my daughters, sometimes they use Cree often, understanding a little.
I’m happy when I hear them use Cree.
It feels nice, when I hear it, young people using this language, the Cree language.
I thought it was good then how he taght Cree, with syllabics.
He would often constantly tell us spiritual stories.
I was happy then, he knows a lot, for instance how Cree words are pronounced.
He knows a lot.
And we stand up together for our language.
And, here, it’s hard.
English, all, well, everyone here they all speak English.
And also, I remember once, what my father told me: we were given this language to use in prayer.
That’s why I understand this Cree language.
Every morning, when I wake up, I try to use this language in prayer, just as my father told me. (4:20)
And also, we are often helped by other Cree speakers to understand the language.
I like it, I’m grateful to other Cree speakers who helped me. (4:45)
That’s all I want to say for now.
I’m very grateful to all of you for what you asked me.
Thank you.
