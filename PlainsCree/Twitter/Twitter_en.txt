Be careful all of you
Take good care of yourselves 
Watch over yourselves 
All of you pray
You can do it
It probably isnâ€™t fun anymore
Bad kid
To persevere
I will serenade for you
I will sing for you
you are loved

Do you like fish?
Yes, we eat many fish.
How many fish are in your nets?
We caught twenty fish.
Are your fish big?
Some fish are big, but some are small.
There are plenty of fish.
Think nothing of it. 
Wake up and rise!
It is truly a good morning!
I love you
