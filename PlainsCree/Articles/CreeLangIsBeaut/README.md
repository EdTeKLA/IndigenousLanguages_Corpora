abstract={...]when a faulty linguistic description that clearly does not adequately describe the language's patterns is encountered, the native-speaking teacher, who can easily find these exceptions, could conclude that the language is not as ordered as the linguistic model of it claims it is. There appears to be a very specific logic to this organization (cf. Because everything in the language is interconnected with everything else, understanding this pattern requires a bit of understanding about the rest of the verb system. ...]using an obviative form for someone that is talking to the speaker conveys that the speaker was mentally "gone" at the time of the event (e.g. drunk, asleep, unaware), and only heard about it from someone else. ...]it's always more difficult to make something true for the hearer than it is for the speaker - if I tell you that I'm late because your husband is sick, there are not a lot of ways that I could know more about that than you do, so the demands of evidence on me are very high.},
